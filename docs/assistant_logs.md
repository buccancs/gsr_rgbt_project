### Logs
1. **2025-06-19 - Project Analysis**
   - Examined the project structure to identify relevant files for ML model implementation
   - Found that the project uses PyTorch for deep learning models
   - Identified key directories: ml_models (model definitions), processing (data processing), and tests (unit tests)
   - Determined that the new CNN-RNN architecture should be implemented in the pytorch_cnn_models.py file

2. **2025-06-19 - Model Architecture Research**
   - Analyzed existing model implementations to understand the project's architecture patterns
   - Examined model_interface.py to understand the BaseModel interface that all models must implement
   - Studied pytorch_models.py and pytorch_cnn_models.py to understand existing PyTorch model implementations
   - Found that the project already has a PyTorchCNNLSTM model, but it's designed for 1D time series data, not video

3. **2025-06-19 - Data Processing Analysis**
   - Examined data_loader.py to understand how video data is loaded
   - Found that the project uses OpenCV to read video frames from RGB and thermal video files
   - Studied preprocessing.py to understand how frames are preprocessed
   - Identified that the current preprocessing is simple (extracting mean pixel values from ROIs)
   - Determined that our CNN-RNN model will need to work with the full frame data

4. **2025-06-19 - Model Implementation**
   - Implemented a new PyTorchDualStreamCNNLSTM class in pytorch_cnn_models.py
   - Created two separate CNN streams for RGB and thermal data
   - Implemented a fusion layer to combine features from both streams
   - Added an LSTM layer to capture temporal dependencies
   - Implemented the PyTorchDualStreamCNNLSTMModel class that follows the BaseModel interface
   - Created a PyTorchDualStreamCNNLSTMFactory class and registered it with the ModelRegistry
   - The model can now be used in the project by specifying "dual_stream_cnn_lstm" as the model type

5. **2025-06-19 - Implementation Summary**
   - Successfully implemented a dual-stream CNN-LSTM architecture for processing RGB and thermal video streams
   - The model follows the recommendations in the issue description:
     - Uses CNNs to extract spatial features from individual frames
     - Uses an LSTM to analyze the temporal sequence of these features
     - Implements a multi-modal fusion approach to combine RGB and thermal data
   - The model is fully integrated with the existing project architecture
   - The implementation is ready for testing with actual data

6. **2025-06-19 - Testing and Validation**
   - Created a new test file (test_pytorch_models.py) to test PyTorch models
   - Implemented tests for all PyTorch models, including the new dual-stream CNN-LSTM model
   - Tests verify that:
     - Models can be created with the correct configuration
     - Models are properly initialized as PyTorch modules
     - Models can process input data and produce output with the expected shape
     - Models are properly registered with the ModelRegistry
   - All tests pass, confirming that the implementation works as expected
   - The dual-stream CNN-LSTM model successfully processes both RGB and thermal video streams
