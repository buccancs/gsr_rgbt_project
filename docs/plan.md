# GSR-RGBT Project Improvement Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the GSR-RGBT (Galvanic Skin Response - RGB-Thermal) project. The plan is based on a thorough analysis of the current implementation, recent improvements, and future considerations identified in the project documentation. The goal is to provide a roadmap for enhancing the project's capabilities, robustness, and usability.

## 1. Data Acquisition and Synchronization

### 1.1 Hardware Synchronization Implementation

**Current State:** The project currently uses a software-based approach for synchronizing data from different sources (RGB video, thermal video, and GSR sensor). While recent improvements have added a centralized timestamp authority, hardware synchronization would provide more precise alignment.

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement the Arduino-based LED flash system for precise synchronization as mentioned in the improvements_summary.md
- Create a hardware trigger mechanism that can be detected in all data streams
- Develop a calibration procedure to measure and account for device-specific latencies

**Rationale:** Hardware synchronization will significantly improve the temporal alignment of multimodal data, which is critical for accurate GSR prediction from video streams. This addresses one of the key challenges identified in the timestamp synchronization research.

### 1.2 Enhanced Real-time Visualization

**Current State:** The GUI has been enhanced to include real-time visualization of GSR data, but there's potential for more comprehensive visualization of all data streams.

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Add real-time visualization of extracted ROI features from video streams
- Implement split-screen views showing the detected hand landmarks and ROIs
- Create a dashboard-style interface with customizable visualization panels
- Add real-time quality indicators for signal strength and synchronization status

**Rationale:** Enhanced visualization will provide immediate feedback during data collection, helping researchers identify and address issues promptly. This will improve the quality of collected data and reduce the need for post-collection data cleaning.

## 2. Data Processing Pipeline

### 2.1 Further Modularization of Feature Engineering

**Current State:** The feature engineering pipeline has been improved to better utilize the Multi-ROI approach and avoid data leakage, but there's room for further modularization.

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Refactor the feature extraction code into a plugin-based architecture
- Create a standardized interface for feature extractors
- Implement additional feature extraction methods (e.g., optical flow, texture analysis)
- Develop a feature selection module to automatically identify the most informative features

**Rationale:** A more modular feature engineering pipeline will make it easier to experiment with different feature extraction methods and adapt to new research questions. This addresses the future consideration mentioned in implementation_notes.md.

### 2.2 Improved Thermal Data Utilization

**Current State:** Support for thermal video in dual-stream models has been added, but the thermal data processing could be enhanced.

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement specialized preprocessing techniques for thermal imagery
- Develop thermal-specific feature extractors that leverage temperature gradients
- Create fusion methods that optimally combine information from RGB and thermal streams
- Research and implement temperature calibration for more accurate thermal readings

**Rationale:** Thermal data provides unique physiological information that complements RGB data. Better utilization of thermal data could significantly improve GSR prediction accuracy.

## 3. Machine Learning Models

### 3.1 Advanced Model Architectures

**Current State:** The project supports several model architectures (LSTM, Autoencoder, VAE, CNN, CNN-LSTM, Transformer, ResNet), but there's potential for exploring more advanced architectures.

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement attention mechanisms for better temporal modeling
- Develop multimodal fusion architectures specifically designed for RGB-T data
- Explore graph neural networks for modeling relationships between different ROIs
- Implement contrastive learning approaches for better feature representations

**Rationale:** Advanced model architectures could better capture the complex relationships between video features and GSR signals, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

### 3.2 Experiment Tracking Integration

**Current State:** The project has improved model run ID extraction in experiment comparison, but a more comprehensive experiment tracking solution would be beneficial.

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Integrate a dedicated experiment tracking tool like MLflow or Weights & Biases
- Implement automatic logging of hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Create a web-based dashboard for comparing experiments
- Develop a standardized reporting system for experiment results

**Rationale:** Proper experiment tracking will make it easier to organize, compare, and reproduce experiments. This addresses the future consideration mentioned in implementation_notes.md.

## 4. Testing and Validation

### 4.1 Automated Testing Framework

**Current State:** The project lacks a comprehensive automated testing framework, which is essential for ensuring code quality and preventing regressions.

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement unit tests for core functionality
- Create integration tests for the complete pipeline
- Develop regression tests to prevent reintroduction of fixed bugs
- Implement continuous integration to automatically run tests on code changes

**Rationale:** Automated testing will help ensure that the codebase remains robust as it evolves. This addresses the future consideration mentioned in implementation_notes.md.

### 4.2 Validation Tools for Synchronization

**Current State:** While the project has improved data synchronization, tools for quantitatively assessing synchronization accuracy are needed.

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Develop metrics for measuring synchronization accuracy
- Create visualization tools for inspecting temporal alignment
- Implement automated detection of synchronization issues
- Design experiments to validate synchronization methods

**Rationale:** Validation tools will help ensure that the synchronization methods are working correctly and provide a way to compare different approaches.

## 5. User Experience and Documentation

### 5.1 Enhanced User Interface

**Current State:** The GUI has been improved with real-time visualization and better organization, but there's potential for further enhancements.

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement a wizard-style interface for guiding users through the data collection process
- Create a session management system for organizing recordings
- Add user authentication and role-based access control
- Develop a more intuitive interface for configuring hardware settings

**Rationale:** An enhanced user interface will make the application more accessible to researchers with varying levels of technical expertise.

### 5.2 Comprehensive Documentation

**Current State:** The project has good documentation of recent improvements and the project's evolution, but a more comprehensive documentation system would be beneficial.

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Create a user manual with step-by-step instructions for common tasks
- Develop API documentation for all modules and classes
- Implement interactive tutorials for new users
