# System Integrations

## RGBTPhys_CPP Integration

### Overview

The RGBTPhys_CPP library provides synchronized data capture from RGB cameras, thermal cameras, and physiological sensors, which is essential for accurate multi-modal data analysis.

### Purpose

The integration of RGBTPhys_CPP enables:

1. **Synchronized Data Capture**: Ensures that all data streams (RGB video, thermal video, and physiological data) are captured with precise timing synchronization.
2. **Improved Performance**: The C++ implementation offers better performance for real-time data capture compared to pure Python implementations.
3. **Consistent Data Format**: Standardizes the data format across different capture modalities, making subsequent analysis more straightforward.

### Implementation Details

#### Integration Approach

The integration is implemented through a Python wrapper class (`RGBTPhysCaptureThread`) that:

1. Extends the existing `BaseCaptureThread` class to maintain consistency with the project's architecture
2. Launches the RGBTPhys_CPP executable as a subprocess
3. Monitors the output of the subprocess to detect when new data is captured
4. Emits PyQt signals with the captured data and timestamps

#### Key Components

- **RGBTPhysCaptureThread**: The main Python wrapper class that interfaces with RGBTPhys_CPP
- **RGBTPhys_CPP**: The C++ library that handles the actual data capture and synchronization
- **test_rgbt_phys_integration.py**: A test script to verify the integration

### Internal Synchronization

RGBTPhys_CPP implements a sophisticated synchronization system to ensure that all data streams (RGB video, thermal video, and physiological data) are properly time-aligned:

#### Timestamp-based Synchronization

1. **High-precision Timestamps**: Each frame and physiological data point is tagged with a high-precision timestamp (nanosecond resolution) using `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock`.

2. **Central Clock**: A central clock thread generates timestamps at a fixed frequency (typically 1000 Hz) to provide a common time reference for all data streams.

3. **Timestamp Interpolation**: For data streams with different sampling rates, timestamps are interpolated to align with the central clock.

4. **Timestamp Logging**: All timestamps are logged to files for post-processing alignment if needed.

#### Hardware-level Synchronization

1. **Thread Priority Management**: Capture threads are assigned high priority to minimize scheduling jitter.

2. **Buffer Management**: Carefully designed buffer systems prevent data loss during high-load situations.

3. **Frame Dropping Prevention**: The system is designed to prevent frame dropping, with monitoring and warning systems in place.

4. **Synchronization Verification**: The system continuously monitors the synchronization quality and logs any discrepancies.

### Usage

#### Basic Usage

```python
from src.capture.rgbt_phys_capture import RGBTPhysCaptureThread

# Create an instance of the RGBTPhys capture thread
rgbt_phys = RGBTPhysCaptureThread(
    config_file="default_config",
    base_save_path="/path/to/save/data",
    participant_id="subject_01",
    simulation_mode=False  # Set to True for simulation mode
)

# Connect signals to your data processing methods
rgbt_phys.rgb_frame_captured.connect(your_rgb_processing_method)
rgbt_phys.thermal_frame_captured.connect(your_thermal_processing_method)
rgbt_phys.phys_data_captured.connect(your_phys_processing_method)

# Start the capture
rgbt_phys.start()

# ... your application code ...

# Stop the capture when done
rgbt_phys.stop()
```

#### Configuration

The RGBTPhys_CPP library uses configuration files to specify capture parameters. Several default configuration files are provided in the RGBTPhys_CPP directory:

- `default_config`: Basic configuration for standard capture
- `config_baseline`: Configuration for baseline recordings
- `config_math_difficult`: Configuration for difficult math task recordings
- `config_math_easy`: Configuration for easy math task recordings
- `config_movement`: Configuration for movement recordings

You can also create custom configuration files as needed.

#### Simulation Mode

For development and testing without hardware, the `RGBTPhysCaptureThread` class provides a simulation mode that generates synthetic data:

```python
rgbt_phys = RGBTPhysCaptureThread(
    config_file="default_config",
    base_save_path="/path/to/save/data",
    participant_id="subject_01",
    simulation_mode=True  # Enable simulation mode
)
```

## Shimmer Integration

### Overview

The Shimmer integration allows the application to capture and process physiological data from Shimmer devices, specifically Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals.

The project includes several components that work together to provide a seamless experience when working with Shimmer devices:

1. **Automatic COM Port Detection**: The application automatically detects the COM port of connected Shimmer devices.
2. **Dynamic Sensor Configuration**: Users can specify which sensors to enable on the Shimmer device.
3. **Unified API Adapter**: The ShimmerAdapter class provides a unified interface to multiple Shimmer APIs.
4. **Integration with RGBTPhys_CPP**: The Shimmer devices can be used with RGBTPhys_CPP for advanced processing.

### Configuration

To use a Shimmer device with RGBTPhys_CPP, you need to configure the following parameters in your configuration file:

```
capture_phys = true
com_port = COM4  # Change to your Shimmer device's COM port
baud_rate = 2000000
phys_channels = EDA,Resp,PPG Finger,PPG Ear,arduino_ts,EventCode
is_shimmer_device = true
shimmer_device_type = GSR+  # Change to your Shimmer device type
```

#### Configuration Parameters

- **capture_phys**: Set to `true` to enable physiological data capture.
- **com_port**: The serial port where your Shimmer device is connected (e.g., `COM4` on Windows).
- **baud_rate**: The baud rate for serial communication with the Shimmer device.
- **phys_channels**: A comma-separated list of physiological channels to capture. For Shimmer GSR+ devices, this typically includes:
  - `EDA`: Electrodermal Activity (another term for GSR)
  - `Resp`: Respiration
  - `PPG Finger`: PPG signal from a finger sensor
  - `PPG Ear`: PPG signal from an ear sensor
  - `arduino_ts`: Timestamp from the device
  - `EventCode`: Event marker
- **is_shimmer_device**: Set to `true` to enable Shimmer-specific processing.
- **shimmer_device_type**: The type of Shimmer device you're using (e.g., `GSR+`).

### Supported Shimmer Devices

The current implementation supports the following Shimmer devices:

- **Shimmer GSR+**: Captures GSR (EDA) and PPG signals.

### Data Processing

When using a Shimmer device, RGBTPhys_CPP performs the following processing:

#### GSR (EDA) Processing

- Converts raw GSR values (typically in kOhms) to calibrated values in microSiemens (µS).
- The conversion formula is: `microSiemens = 1000.0 / gsr_value_in_kOhms`
- This conversion makes the values more intuitive for analysis, as higher conductance (lower resistance) corresponds to higher arousal.

#### PPG Processing

- Captures raw PPG signals from finger and/or ear sensors.
- Logs the values for further processing.
- Future enhancements may include real-time peak detection and heart rate calculation.

### Data Output

The physiological data is saved to a CSV file in the specified output directory. The file includes:

1. A header row with the channel names (from the `phys_channels` parameter).
2. Data rows with comma-separated values for each channel.

The filename includes a timestamp to ensure uniqueness.

### New Features

#### Automatic COM Port Detection

The `find_shimmer_com_port` function in `src/utils/device_utils.py` automatically scans all available COM ports and identifies the one connected to a Shimmer device. This eliminates the need for users to manually configure the COM port.

```python
from src.utils.device_utils import find_shimmer_com_port, DeviceNotFoundError

try:
    shimmer_port = find_shimmer_com_port()
    print(f"Found Shimmer device on port {shimmer_port}")
except DeviceNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

#### Dynamic Sensor Configuration

The `ShimmerAdapter` class allows dynamic configuration of which sensors to enable on the Shimmer device:

```python
from src.utils.shimmer_adapter import ShimmerAdapter

adapter = ShimmerAdapter()
adapter.configure_sensors(['GSR', 'PPG'])  # Enable only GSR and PPG sensors
```

### Integration with Other Components

The Shimmer GSR and PPG data can be used in conjunction with other components of the GSR-RGBT project:

- **Synchronized with RGB and thermal video**: The physiological data is time-synchronized with the video data, allowing for multimodal analysis.
- **Analysis with neurokit2 and physiokit**: The captured data can be processed and analyzed using the neurokit2 and physiokit libraries.
- **Ground truth for remote sensing**: The contact-based measurements can serve as ground truth for remote physiological sensing algorithms.
