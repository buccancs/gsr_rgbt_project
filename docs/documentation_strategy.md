# GSR-RGBT Project Documentation Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines the documentation strategy for the GSR-RGBT project, including the structure of the documentation, guidelines for maintaining and updating documentation, and best practices for creating new documentation. The goal is to provide a clear and consistent approach to documentation that makes it easy for users and developers to find the information they need.

## Documentation Structure

The GSR-RGBT project documentation is organized into the following categories:

### 1. Project Overview Documentation

- **README.md**: The main entry point for the project, providing a high-level overview, installation instructions, and basic usage examples.
- **SUMMARY.md**: A summary of the project's purpose, features, and components.
- **guide.md**: A user guide for the project, focusing on how to use the application.

### 2. Project Timeline Documentation

- **project_timeline.md**: A comprehensive timeline of the project's development, including historical development, major iterations, key technical achievements, and future plans. This document consolidates information from:
  - repository_development_timeline.md (detailed commit history)
  - project_evolution_timeline.md (conceptual history of major iterations)
  - project_plan_timeline.md (forward-looking plan)
  - project_development_summary.md (high-level summary of development phases)

### 3. Technical Documentation

- **technical_guide.md**: A comprehensive technical guide covering hardware setup, device integration, data synchronization, and system validation. This document consolidates information from:
  - device_integration.md (device integration details)
  - equipment_setup.md (hardware setup instructions)
  - shimmer_integration.md (Shimmer3 GSR+ integration)
  - timestamp_synchronization.md (synchronization methods)
  - synchronization.md (synchronization approach)

### 4. Implementation Documentation

- **implementation_overview.md**: A comprehensive overview of the implementation details and improvements made to the project. This document consolidates information from:
  - implementation_notes.md (detailed implementation notes)
  - implementation_improvements.md (key improvements)
  - code_improvements_summary.md (code organization improvements)
  - improvements_summary.md (broader improvements)

### 5. Architecture Documentation

- **src/ARCHITECTURE.md**: An overview of the project's architecture, including the current structure, proposed improved structure, module boundaries, naming conventions, and documentation guidelines.

### 6. Research Documentation

- **research_report.md**: A report on the research conducted for the project.
- **proposal.tex** and **proposal_updated.tex**: Research proposals for the project.
- **appendix.tex**: Additional research materials.
- **data_collection_initial.tex** and **data_collection_revised.tex**: Data collection protocols.
- **consent_form.tex** and **information_sheet.tex**: Forms for study participants.

## Documentation Consolidation Rationale

The documentation consolidation was performed to address several issues with the previous documentation structure:

1. **Redundancy**: Many documents contained overlapping information, leading to duplication and potential inconsistencies.
2. **Fragmentation**: Related information was spread across multiple documents, making it difficult to find comprehensive information on a specific topic.
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Having multiple documents with overlapping content made it difficult to keep all documentation up-to-date and consistent.

The consolidation approach focused on:

1. **Thematic Organization**: Grouping documents by theme (timeline, technical, implementation) to make it easier to find related information.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensuring that each consolidated document provides complete coverage of its topic.
3. **Clear Structure**: Using consistent headings, sections, and formatting to make the documentation easy to navigate.
4. **Cross-Referencing**: Including references to related documents to help users find additional information.

## Documentation Maintenance Guidelines

### General Guidelines

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information should have a single authoritative source. Avoid duplicating information across multiple documents.
2. **Keep Documentation Updated**: Update documentation whenever code changes are made that affect the documented behavior.
3. **Use Clear Language**: Write in clear, concise language that is easy to understand.
4. **Include Examples**: Provide examples to illustrate concepts and usage.
5. **Use Consistent Formatting**: Follow consistent formatting conventions throughout the documentation.

### Updating Consolidated Documents

When updating the consolidated documents, follow these guidelines:

1. **Maintain Structure**: Preserve the overall structure of the document to ensure consistency.
2. **Update Related Sections**: When adding or modifying information, check if other sections of the document need to be updated for consistency.
3. **Preserve Cross-References**: Ensure that cross-references to other documents remain valid.
4. **Update Table of Contents**: If adding new sections, update the table of contents accordingly.

### Creating New Documentation

When creating new documentation, follow these guidelines:

1. **Determine Appropriate Category**: Decide which category the new documentation belongs to (overview, timeline, technical, implementation, architecture, research).
2. **Check for Existing Documentation**: Before creating new documentation, check if the information could be added to an existing document.
3. **Follow Template**: Use the existing documents in the same category as templates for structure and formatting.
4. **Include Metadata**: Add metadata such as creation date, author, and last updated date.
5. **Cross-Reference**: Include references to related documents.

## Documentation Best Practices

### Markdown Formatting

1. **Use Headings**: Use headings (# for main heading, ## for section headings, etc.) to organize content.
2. **Use Lists**: Use bullet points (- or *) for unordered lists and numbers (1., 2., etc.) for ordered lists.
3. **Use Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (```) for code blocks, with the language specified for syntax highlighting.
4. **Use Tables**: Use Markdown tables for tabular data.
5. **Use Links**: Use links to reference other documents or external resources.

### Code Documentation

1. **Use Docstrings**: Document all classes, methods, and functions with docstrings following the Google style guide.
2. **Include Examples**: Provide usage examples in docstrings.
3. **Document Parameters**: Document all parameters, return values, and exceptions.
4. **Explain Complex Logic**: Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious code.

### README Guidelines

1. **Project Overview**: Start with a brief overview of the project.
2. **Installation Instructions**: Provide clear installation instructions.
3. **Basic Usage**: Include basic usage examples.
4. **Configuration**: Explain how to configure the project.
5. **Contributing**: Include guidelines for contributing to the project.
6. **License**: Include license information.

## Future Documentation Development

### Planned Documentation Improvements

1. **Interactive Documentation**: Consider adding interactive documentation using tools like Jupyter notebooks or interactive web pages.
2. **Video Tutorials**: Create video tutorials for complex setup procedures or usage scenarios.
3. **API Documentation**: Generate comprehensive API documentation using tools like Sphinx or Doxygen.
4. **User Guides**: Develop more detailed user guides for specific use cases.
5. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Create a comprehensive troubleshooting guide that covers common issues and their solutions.

### Documentation Review Process

To ensure the quality and accuracy of documentation, implement a regular review process:

1. **Peer Review**: Have documentation reviewed by other team members before publishing.
2. **User Testing**: Test documentation with users to ensure it is clear and helpful.
3. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of documentation to identify outdated or inaccurate information.
4. **Feedback Mechanism**: Provide a way for users to give feedback on documentation.

## Conclusion

This documentation strategy provides a framework for organizing, maintaining, and developing documentation for the GSR-RGBT project. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that the documentation remains comprehensive, consistent, and useful for both users and developers.

The consolidated documentation structure addresses the issues of redundancy, fragmentation, and maintenance burden in the previous documentation, while providing a clear path for future documentation development.
