# GSR-RGBT Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized checklist of tasks for improving the GSR-RGBT project codebase. Each task is categorized and ordered by importance and dependency relationships.

## Code Quality and Organization

[ ] Fix the main.py file which currently contains config.py content instead of the application entry point
[ ] Add missing imports in data_loader.py (numpy, csv)
[ ] Standardize logging configuration across all modules
[ ] Implement proper error handling for hardware failures (camera disconnection, sensor issues)
[ ] Add type hints to all functions and methods for better code readability and IDE support
[ ] Refactor duplicate code in preprocessing and feature engineering modules
[ ] Implement consistent naming conventions across the codebase
[ ] Add linting configuration (.flake8, .pylintrc) to enforce code style
[ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for automatic code formatting and linting

## Testing and Quality Assurance

[ ] Increase unit test coverage for all modules (aim for at least 80% coverage)
[ ] Add integration tests for the complete data processing pipeline
[ ] Implement end-to-end tests for the GUI application
[ ] Create test fixtures for common test data to reduce duplication
[ ] Add performance benchmarks for critical processing functions
[ ] Implement continuous integration (CI) workflow
[ ] Add automated test runs on CI for all pull requests
[ ] Create a test data generator for simulating various sensor inputs

## Documentation

[ ] Create comprehensive API documentation for all modules
[ ] Add docstrings to all classes and functions that are missing them
[ ] Create a developer guide with setup instructions and contribution guidelines
[ ] Document the data format specifications for all inputs and outputs
[ ] Create flowcharts for the data processing pipeline
[ ] Add inline comments for complex algorithms
[ ] Create user documentation for the GUI application
[ ] Document the model architectures and their parameters
[ ] Add a changelog to track version changes

## Architecture and Design

[ ] Implement a proper application entry point in main.py
[ ] Refactor the GUI code to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
[ ] Create a proper dependency injection system for better testability
[ ] Implement a plugin architecture for different sensor types
[ ] Separate configuration into environment-specific files
[ ] Create a unified error handling and reporting system
[ ] Implement a proper logging strategy with rotating file handlers
