# GSR-RGBT Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized checklist of tasks for improving the GSR-RGBT project codebase. Each task is categorized and ordered by importance and dependency relationships.

## Code Quality and Organization

[x] Fix the main.py file which currently contains config.py content instead of the application entry point
[x] Add missing imports in data_loader.py (numpy, csv)
[x] Standardize logging configuration across all modules
[ ] Implement proper error handling for hardware failures (camera disconnection, sensor issues)
[x] Add type hints to all functions and methods for better code readability and IDE support
[x] Refactor duplicate code in preprocessing and feature engineering modules
[x] Implement consistent naming conventions across the codebase
[ ] Add linting configuration (.flake8, .pylintrc) to enforce code style
[ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for automatic code formatting and linting

## Testing and Quality Assurance

[x] Increase unit test coverage for all modules (aim for at least 80% coverage)
[x] Add integration tests for the complete data processing pipeline
[ ] Implement end-to-end tests for the GUI application
[x] Create test fixtures for common test data to reduce duplication
[x] Add performance benchmarks for critical processing functions
[ ] Implement continuous integration (CI) workflow
[ ] Add automated test runs on CI for all pull requests
[x] Create a test data generator for simulating various sensor inputs

## Documentation

[x] Create comprehensive API documentation for all modules
[x] Add docstrings to all classes and functions that are missing them
[x] Create a developer guide with setup instructions and contribution guidelines
[x] Document the data format specifications for all inputs and outputs
[x] Create flowcharts for the data processing pipeline
[x] Add inline comments for complex algorithms
[x] Create user documentation for the GUI application
[x] Document the model architectures and their parameters
[x] Add a changelog to track version changes

## Architecture and Design

[x] Implement a proper application entry point in main.py
[x] Refactor the GUI code to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
[x] Create a proper dependency injection system for better testability
[x] Implement a plugin architecture for different sensor types
[x] Separate configuration into environment-specific files
[x] Create a unified error handling and reporting system
[x] Implement a proper logging strategy with rotating file handlers
[x] Design a more modular architecture for the ML pipeline components
[x] Create interfaces for key components to allow for alternative implementations

## Performance Optimization

[x] Profile the data processing pipeline to identify bottlenecks
[x] Optimize video frame processing for real-time performance
[x] Implement parallel processing for CPU-intensive tasks
[x] Add caching for frequently accessed data
[x] Optimize memory usage during model training
[x] Implement early stopping with better hyperparameters
[x] Investigate GPU acceleration for model training
[x] Optimize data loading and preprocessing for large datasets
[x] Implement batch processing for feature extraction
