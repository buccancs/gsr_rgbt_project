# GSR-RGBT Project Tasks

This document outlines the tasks that need to be completed for the GSR-RGBT project refactoring. As tasks are completed, mark them as done by changing the checkbox from [ ] to [x].

## Module Refactoring Tasks

- [x] Create specific capture implementations (GSR, Thermal, Video)
- [ ] Refactor existing main.py to use new core modules
- [ ] Create ML model structure with proper organization
- [ ] Build GUI components with separation of concerns

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Refactor main.py to demonstrate new architecture
- [x] Create GSR capture implementation using new base classes
- [x] Create thermal and video capture implementations
- [ ] Build data processing pipeline structure
- [ ] Refactor ML models into organized packages
- [ ] Create GUI application structure
- [ ] Implement utilities and helper modules
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing framework
- [ ] Performance optimization and caching
- [ ] Documentation and examples

## Success Criteria

- [x] All files follow pythonic naming conventions
- [x] Code passes import tests without errors
- [x] All functions have type hints and docstrings (for new modules)
- [x] No duplicate code in new modules
- [x] Custom exception hierarchy implemented
- [x] Configuration system with validation
- [ ] All existing functionality maintained
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] Code is more maintainable and readable

## Testing Tasks

- [ ] Expand test coverage to include more edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Implement property-based testing for complex algorithms
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks to regression tests
- [ ] Implement continuous integration to automatically run tests on code changes
- [ ] Create visual regression tests for GUI components
- [ ] Develop automated end-to-end tests with real hardware

## Documentation Tasks

- [ ] Update README.md with new architecture information
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add examples for complex functionality
- [ ] Document architectural decisions
