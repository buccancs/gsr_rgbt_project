## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment following the instructions in the [Developer Onboarding Guide](developer_onboarding.md)
4. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
5. Make your changes
6. Run tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
7. Submit a pull request

## Development Workflow

We follow a feature branch workflow:

1. **Main Branch**: The `main` branch contains the stable version of the code. All development is done in feature branches.
2. **Feature Branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. Branch names should be descriptive and follow the format: `feature/feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-description`.
3. **Pull Requests**: When your feature or bug fix is ready, submit a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch.
4. **Code Review**: All pull requests must be reviewed by at least one maintainer before being merged.
5. **Continuous Integration**: All pull requests must pass the CI pipeline before being merged.

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length is 127 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules following the Google style guide

### Documentation Style

- Use Markdown for documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where appropriate

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - ‚ú® `:sparkles:` for new features
  - üêõ `:bug:` for bug fixes
  - üìö `:books:` for documentation changes
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è `:recycle:` for refactoring code
  - üß™ `:test_tube:` for adding tests
  - üîß `:wrench:` for configuration changes

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md and documentation with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with details of changes
3. The version number will be updated by the maintainers following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
4. Ensure all tests pass and the CI pipeline is successful
5. Get at least one review from a maintainer
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your pull request
