# Implementation Improvements: Addressing Key Issues in the GSR-RGBT Project

## Overview

This document outlines the significant improvements made to the GSR-RGBT project to address several critical issues identified in a comprehensive code review. The changes focus on three main areas:

1. **Enhanced ROI Detection**: Implementing a robust Multi-ROI approach using MediaPipe hand landmarks
2. **Improved Data Synchronization**: Creating a centralized timestamp authority for precise temporal alignment
3. **Refined Feature Engineering**: Updating the feature extraction pipeline to better utilize thermal data and avoid data leakage

These improvements address fundamental architectural and methodological issues that were limiting the project's effectiveness and potential for high-quality results.

## 1. Enhanced ROI Detection with MediaPipe

### Issue
The original implementation relied on a simple `detect_palm_roi` function that often fell back to a fixed, centered rectangle when hand detection failed. This approach was brittle and could lead to extracting signals from irrelevant parts of the frame if the hand moved.

### Solution
We've implemented a robust Multi-ROI approach using MediaPipe hand landmarks:

- **Multiple Regions of Interest**: Instead of a single ROI, we now extract signals from three physiologically significant regions:
  - Index finger base (high concentration of sweat glands)
  - Ring finger base (strong vascular patterns)
  - Center of the palm (stable reference point)

- **Robust Hand Tracking**: MediaPipe provides accurate hand landmark detection that is resilient to hand movements and lighting changes.

- **Richer Feature Set**: By combining signals from multiple ROIs, we create a more comprehensive feature vector that captures more information about the hand's physiological state.

### Implementation
- Modified `create_dataset_from_session` to use `process_frame_with_multi_roi` instead of `detect_palm_roi`
- Updated the feature column naming scheme to reflect the Multi-ROI approach
- Ensured both RGB and thermal video processing use the same Multi-ROI approach

## 2. Improved Data Synchronization

### Issue
The original system relied on "optimistic" software-based synchronization, with each component generating its own timestamps. This could lead to drift between data streams, especially under system load, potentially causing misalignment between video features and GSR values.

### Solution
We've implemented a centralized timestamp authority:

- **TimestampThread Class**: A high-priority thread that emits timestamps at a fast, consistent rate (200Hz by default)
- **Shared Timestamp Source**: All capture components now use timestamps from this central authority
- **High-Resolution Timing**: Using `time.perf_counter_ns()` for nanosecond precision

### Implementation
- Created a new `TimestampThread` class in `src/utils/timestamp_thread.py`
- Updated the `Application` class to create, start, and stop the timestamp thread
- Modified the capture thread connections to use the centralized timestamps

## 3. Refined Feature Engineering

### Issue
The feature engineering pipeline had two significant issues:
1. It didn't fully utilize the Multi-ROI approach that was already implemented in the codebase
2. It included GSR_Tonic as a feature, which gave the model a "cheat sheet" by providing a modified version of the target

### Solution
We've refined the feature engineering pipeline:

- **Full Multi-ROI Integration**: The pipeline now properly extracts and processes signals from multiple ROIs
- **Removed Data Leakage**: GSR_Tonic has been removed from the feature set to ensure the model learns from video features only
- **Improved Dual-Stream Support**: Updated the code that reshapes features for dual-stream models to handle the new feature structure

### Implementation
- Updated the feature column generation to create columns for each ROI and channel
- Removed GSR_Tonic from the feature set
- Modified the dual-stream feature reshaping to use column name prefixes instead of fixed indices

## Future Considerations

While these improvements address the most critical issues, there are additional enhancements that could further improve the project:

1. **Experimental Protocol Control**: Adding a Protocol Control panel to the GUI with task name display and countdown timer
2. **Event Marking**: Implementing a `log_event` function in the DataLogger to mark experimental events
3. **Advanced Fusion Techniques**: Exploring more sophisticated methods for fusing RGB and thermal features
4. **Thermal-Specific Features**: Extracting temperature-based features from thermal data instead of treating it like RGB data

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the robustness and effectiveness of the GSR-RGBT project. By implementing a proper Multi-ROI approach, improving data synchronization, and refining the feature engineering pipeline, we've addressed the most critical issues identified in the code review. These changes provide a solid foundation for achieving high-quality results and advancing the research goals of contactless GSR prediction.
