# GSR-RGBT Project Development Workflow

## Introduction

This comprehensive guide covers the complete development pipeline for the GSR-RGBT project, including continuous integration, GitHub Actions workflows, and pre-commit hooks. It provides developers with everything they need to understand and contribute to the project's automated development processes.

The development workflow is designed to ensure code quality, catch issues early, and maintain a consistent codebase through automated checks and processes that run from local development to production deployment.

---

# Pre-commit Hooks

## Introduction

Pre-commit hooks are automated checks that run before each commit, helping to ensure code quality, catch issues early, and maintain a consistent codebase. They form the first line of defense in our development workflow.

## Benefits of Pre-commit Hooks

- **Catch issues early**: Identify problems before they're committed to the repository
- **Ensure code quality**: Maintain consistent code style and quality across the project
- **Save time**: Automate repetitive tasks like code formatting and linting
- **Reduce CI failures**: Fix issues locally before pushing to CI
- **Improve collaboration**: Ensure all contributors follow the same standards

## Hooks Included

The GSR-RGBT project uses the following pre-commit hooks:

### Code Quality Hooks

- **trailing-whitespace**: Trims trailing whitespace from files
- **end-of-file-fixer**: Ensures files end with a single newline
- **check-yaml/json/toml**: Validates syntax of YAML, JSON, and TOML files
- **check-added-large-files**: Prevents committing large files (>500KB)
- **check-merge-conflict**: Checks for merge conflict markers
- **detect-private-key**: Prevents committing private keys
- **debug-statements**: Detects debug statements in Python code

### Code Formatting Hooks

- **black**: Formats Python code according to the Black code style
- **isort**: Sorts Python imports
- **prettier**: Formats YAML, JSON, Markdown, and other non-Python files

### Linting Hooks

- **flake8**: Checks Python code for style and potential errors
  - **flake8-docstrings**: Checks docstring style
  - **flake8-bugbear**: Catches common bugs and design problems
  - **flake8-comprehensions**: Helps write better list/dict/set comprehensions

### Static Type Checking

- **mypy**: Performs static type checking on Python code

### Security Checks

- **bandit**: Finds common security issues in Python code

### Testing

- **pytest-check**: Runs unit tests to ensure code changes don't break existing functionality

## Setup

To set up the pre-commit hooks for the GSR-RGBT project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed
2. Run the setup script:

```bash
python setup_hooks.py
```

This script will:
- Install pre-commit if not already installed
- Install all required dependencies
- Set up the hooks to run automatically on each commit
- Optionally run the hooks on all files in the repository

## Usage

Once installed, the pre-commit hooks will run automatically whenever you attempt to commit changes. If any hook fails, the commit will be aborted, and you'll need to fix the issues before trying again.

### Manual Execution

You can also run the hooks manually:

- Run on staged files:
```bash
pre-commit run
```

- Run on all files:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

- Run a specific hook:
```bash
pre-commit run <hook-id>
```

### Skipping Hooks

In rare cases, you may need to skip the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
git commit -m "Your message" --no-verify
```

However, this should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.

## Configuration

The pre-commit hooks are configured in the following files:

- **.pre-commit-config.yaml**: Defines the hooks and their settings
- **pyproject.toml**: Contains configuration for Black, isort, mypy, and bandit

### Customizing Hook Behavior

To customize the behavior of specific hooks, edit the corresponding section in the configuration files. For example, to change the line length for Black and isort, modify the `line-length` parameter in the pyproject.toml file.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Hook installation fails**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed
   - Try running `pip install pre-commit` manually

2. **Hooks are not running**:
   - Ensure hooks are installed with `pre-commit install`
   - Check if you're using `--no-verify` flag with git commit

3. **Hooks are too slow**:
   - Consider disabling the pytest hook for regular commits
   - Run comprehensive checks only in CI

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with the pre-commit hooks:

1. Check the error message for specific guidance
2. Consult the documentation for the specific hook
3. Ask for help from other project contributors

## Best Practices

1. **Run hooks before pushing**: Always run pre-commit hooks before pushing changes
2. **Fix issues promptly**: Address hook failures immediately rather than bypassing them
3. **Keep hooks updated**: Periodically update the hooks with `pre-commit autoupdate`
4. **Add new hooks thoughtfully**: Consider the impact on development workflow before adding new hooks

# GitHub Actions Workflows

## Introduction

This section explains how to work with GitHub Actions workflows in the GSR-RGBT project. GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.

## Understanding the CI Workflow

The GSR-RGBT project uses a CI workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. This workflow:

1. Runs on push to the main branch and on pull requests
2. Sets up a Python environment
3. Installs dependencies
4. Runs linting checks
5. Runs unit, smoke, and regression tests
6. Uploads coverage reports
7. Builds and uploads documentation

## Viewing Workflow Files in GitHub

If you can't see the workflow files in GitHub, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure the workflow files are committed and pushed to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
   git commit -m "Add CI workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub (e.g., `https://github.com/username/gsr_rgbt_project`)
   - Click on the "Actions" tab in the top navigation bar
   - You should see your workflows listed here

3. **Check the file location**:
   - Workflow files must be in the `.github/workflows` directory
   - The file must have a `.yml` or `.yaml` extension
   - The file must be properly formatted YAML

## Adding New Workflows

To add a new workflow:

1. Create a new YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory
2. Define the workflow using the GitHub Actions syntax
3. Commit and push the file to GitHub

Example of a simple workflow:

```yaml
name: Simple Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Say Hello
      run: echo "Hello, World!"
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **Check workflow syntax**:
   - Ensure your YAML file is properly formatted
   - Use a YAML validator to check for syntax errors

2. **Check workflow logs**:
   - Click on a workflow run in the Actions tab
   - Examine the logs for any errors

3. **Check GitHub status**:
   - GitHub Actions might be experiencing issues
   - Check the [GitHub Status page](https://www.githubstatus.com/)

4. **Check repository permissions**:
   - Ensure GitHub Actions is enabled for your repository
   - Go to Settings > Actions > General and check the permissions

# Continuous Integration Setup

## CI Platform

The GSR-RGBT project uses GitHub Actions as its CI platform. GitHub Actions is integrated with the project's GitHub repository and provides automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying the project.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The GSR-RGBT project uses several GitHub Actions workflows to automate different aspects of the development process:

1. **CI Workflow** (ci.yml): The main continuous integration workflow that runs tests and builds documentation.
2. **Security Scanning** (codeql-analysis.yml): A workflow that performs security analysis using GitHub's CodeQL.
3. **Automated Releases** (release.yml): A workflow that automates the creation of releases and publishing to PyPI.
4. **Performance Benchmarking** (benchmark.yml): A workflow that runs performance benchmarks and tracks results over time.

### CI Workflow

The main CI workflow consists of the following jobs:

1. **Lint**: Checks code style and quality using flake8.
2. **Test**: Runs unit, smoke, and regression tests on multiple Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10).
3. **Docs**: Builds the documentation and uploads it as an artifact.

Key features of the CI workflow include:

- **Matrix Testing**: Tests are run on multiple Python versions to ensure compatibility.
- **Dependency Caching**: Dependencies are cached to speed up builds.
- **Scheduled Runs**: The workflow runs automatically on a schedule (nightly) to catch issues early.
- **Manual Triggering**: The workflow can be triggered manually using the workflow_dispatch event.
- **Coverage Reporting**: Test coverage is measured and reported to Codecov.

### Security Scanning Workflow

The security scanning workflow uses GitHub's CodeQL to identify security vulnerabilities in the codebase. It runs:

- On pushes to the main branch
- On pull requests to the main branch
- On a weekly schedule
- When manually triggered

### Automated Release Workflow

The release workflow automates the process of creating releases and publishing packages to PyPI. It is triggered when a tag starting with 'v' is pushed to the repository (e.g., v1.0.0). The workflow:

1. Builds the Python package
2. Generates a changelog based on commits
3. Creates a GitHub release with the changelog
4. Uploads the package as a release asset
5. Publishes the package to PyPI

### Performance Benchmarking Workflow

The benchmarking workflow runs performance tests and tracks results over time. It:

1. Runs on pushes to the main branch
2. Runs on pull requests to the main branch
3. Runs on a weekly schedule
4. Can be triggered manually

The workflow uses pytest-benchmark to run benchmarks and the github-action-benchmark action to visualize and track results. It also sets up alerts for performance regressions.

## Workflow Configurations

          comment-on-alert: true
          fail-on-alert: true
```

## Environment Variables and Secrets

The CI workflows use several environment variables and secrets:

### Required Secrets

- **PYPI_API_TOKEN**: Token for publishing packages to PyPI
- **CODECOV_TOKEN**: Token for uploading coverage reports to Codecov

### Environment Variables

- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- **TWINE_USERNAME**: Set to `__token__` for PyPI token authentication
- **TWINE_PASSWORD**: Set to the PyPI API token

## Monitoring and Notifications

### Coverage Reporting

Test coverage is automatically measured and reported to Codecov. Coverage reports are generated in both XML and HTML formats, with the XML format uploaded to Codecov for tracking over time.

### Performance Monitoring

Performance benchmarks are tracked using the github-action-benchmark action. Results are stored in a separate branch and visualized on GitHub Pages. Alerts are configured to notify when performance degrades by more than 200%.

### Security Alerts

CodeQL security scanning results are automatically reported to GitHub's security tab. Any identified vulnerabilities are flagged for review and remediation.

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design

1. **Keep workflows focused**: Each workflow should have a single, clear purpose
2. **Use matrix builds**: Test across multiple Python versions and operating systems
3. **Cache dependencies**: Use caching to speed up builds and reduce resource usage
4. **Fail fast**: Configure workflows to fail quickly when issues are detected

### Security

1. **Use secrets for sensitive data**: Never hardcode API tokens or passwords
2. **Limit permissions**: Use the minimum required permissions for each workflow
3. **Regular security scans**: Run CodeQL and other security tools regularly
4. **Keep actions updated**: Regularly update action versions to get security fixes

### Performance

1. **Optimize build times**: Use caching and parallel execution where possible
2. **Monitor resource usage**: Keep an eye on build minutes and storage usage
3. **Use appropriate runners**: Choose the right runner type for each job
4. **Clean up artifacts**: Regularly clean up old artifacts to save storage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow not triggering**:
   - Check the trigger conditions in the workflow file
   - Ensure the workflow file is in the correct location
   - Verify that GitHub Actions is enabled for the repository

2. **Build failures**:
   - Check the workflow logs for specific error messages
   - Verify that all required secrets are configured
   - Ensure dependencies are correctly specified

3. **Slow builds**:
   - Review caching configuration
   - Consider splitting large workflows into smaller ones
   - Optimize test execution order

4. **Permission errors**:
   - Check workflow permissions in the YAML file
   - Verify repository settings for GitHub Actions
   - Ensure secrets have the correct permissions

### Debugging Workflows

1. **Enable debug logging**:
   ```yaml
   env:
     ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
     ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
   ```

2. **Use workflow commands**:
   ```bash
   echo "::debug::Debug message"
   echo "::warning::Warning message"
   echo "::error::Error message"
   ```

3. **Add debugging steps**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Debug environment
     run: |
       echo "Python version: $(python --version)"
       echo "Working directory: $(pwd)"
       echo "Environment variables:"
       env | sort
   ```
