# Project Enhancements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the GSR-RGBT project to meet the requirements specified in the issue description:

> Create enough mock data to run machine learning, focus on logging, visualization and reporting. Also read through the add documents to see how models can be extended and changed to achieve better accuracy for all models. And save a milestone of each.

## Key Enhancements

  - Generates data for multiple subjects (configurable)
  - Creates multiple sessions per subject with varying physiological parameters
  - Produces realistic physiological signals with NeuroKit2
  - Generates synchronized RGB and thermal videos

### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline Modernization

- **Created a modular model interface** (`model_interface.py`):
  - Defined abstract base classes for models and model factories
  - Implemented a model registry for easy model creation
  - Provided a common interface for different model implementations

  - LSTM model for time-series regression
  - Autoencoder model for unsupervised feature learning
  - Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model
  - Early stopping implementation for PyTorch training

- **Updated model configuration system** (`model_config.py`):
  - Made configuration framework-agnostic
  - Added support for both PyTorch and TensorFlow models
  - Maintained backward compatibility with legacy TensorFlow models

- **Modified training and inference scripts** to use the new interface:
  - Updated `train_model.py` to support both PyTorch and TensorFlow models
  - Updated `inference.py` to load and use models from either framework

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **Implemented Cython optimizations** for performance-critical functions:
  - Created `cython_optimizations.pyx` with optimized versions of:
    - `cy_create_feature_windows`: Optimized window creation for time-series data
    - `cy_align_signals`: Optimized signal alignment with interpolation
    - `cy_extract_roi_signal`: Optimized ROI signal extraction from video frames

- **Updated `setup.py`** to build Cython extensions:
  - Added compiler directives for maximum performance
  - Configured to build extensions during installation

- **Modified processing modules** to use Cython implementations when available:
  - Updated `feature_engineering.py` to use Cython optimizations
  - Updated `preprocessing.py` to use Cython optimizations
  - Added fallback to pure Python implementations when Cython is not available

### 4. Logging, Visualization, and Reporting

- **Created comprehensive visualization and reporting system** (`visualize_results.py`):
  - Training history visualization (loss curves)
  - Predictions vs. ground truth visualization
  - Performance metrics calculation and reporting
  - Model comparison visualizations
  - Detailed logging of all operations

- **Implemented model milestone saving**:
  - Added functionality to save model checkpoints at key stages
  - Created a system to track model versions and improvements
  - Included metadata with each milestone

### 5. Full Pipeline Integration

- **Created a unified pipeline script** (`run_ml_pipeline.py`):
  - Orchestrates the entire ML workflow from data generation to evaluation
  - Provides command-line options to customize pipeline execution
  - Includes detailed logging and progress tracking
  - Generates a comprehensive summary of pipeline execution
